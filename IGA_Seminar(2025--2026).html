<h2></h2>
<p>The seminar aims to be a relaxed forum for researchers and graduate students interested in geometric analysis, and students of all levels are encouraged to attend and ask questions. 
  Talks will focus on the "big picture" and key ideas and encourage interaction. Talks will be in one of two formats: a) 30-minute talks followed by a ~ 15-30 minute discussion, or 
  b) 50-75 minute talks.</a></p>

            <li><p>Title: Uniqueness of asymptotically conical shrinking gradient Kähler--Ricci solitons</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: We show that, up to biholomorphism, a given noncompact complex manifold admits at most one shrinking gradient
                            Kähler-Ricci soliton with Ricci curvature vanishing at infinity. Time permitting, we will also discuss how the technique for proving the uniqueness 
                            of the soliton vector field can be applied to other settings, such as AC Calabi-Yau manifolds.</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: Geometry of Mean Curvature Flow near Cylindrical Singularities </p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: The cylindrical singularities are prevalent but complicated in geometric flows. We discuss one of the simplest extrinsic flow, the mean curvature flow, 
                             and illustrate how the local dynamics of the singularities influence the singular set itself, and the geometry and topology of the flow. This talk is 
                            based on joint works with Zhihan Wang (Cornell) and Jinxin Xue (Tsinghua).</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: K-semistability at infinity</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: The question of finding and classifying complete Calabi--Yau metrics on smooth affine varieties of Euclidean volume growth goes back to Tian--Yau, 
                             who constructed such metrics on X given by the complement of a Kähler--Einstein divisor in a Fano variety. Recent classification results suggest that 
                             such metrics on smooth affine varieties come from prescribing the asymptotic geometry using a negative valuation. In this talk, I will revisit Tian--Yau's example, 
                             in which case the Kähler--Einstein divisor defines a K-semistable valuation which does not admit a center on X. Generalizing this leads to a valuative criterion for 
                             K-semistable valuations at infinity on a given affine variety. Time permitting, I will also explain that these valuations in fact come from Fano type compactifications 
                             generalizing the Tian--Yau case. This is based on joint work in progress with Mattias Jonsson.</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: Free boundary Monge-Ampere equations and boundary regularity of optimal transport</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: In this talk, I will present a variational framework to solve a general class of free-boundary Monge–Ampère equations. This approach combines the classical first and 
                             second boundary value problems by imposing both the boundary data and the gradient image of the solution. I will explore applications to the Monge–Ampère eigenvalue problem 
                             and a reconstruction theorems, and geometric problems including a hemispherical Minkowski problem, Calabi-Yau metrics, and free boundary toric Kähler–Einstein/Kähler-Ricci 
                            soliton metrics. Furthermore, I will discuss the connection to the boundary regularity of optimal transport and recent progress inspired by geometric regularity theory techniques.

            <li><p>Title: A YTD correspondence for constant scalar curvature metrics</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: Given a compact Kähler manifold, to better understand Mabuchi's  K energy we introduce a family of  K^beta energies, whose favorable properties are similar to those of the 
                             Ding energy from the Fano case. The construction uses Berman's transcendental quantization, and we show that the slope of the K^beta energies along test configurations can 
                             be computed using intersection theory. With these ingredients in place we provide a uniform Yau-Tian-Donaldson correspondence that characterizes the existence of a unique constant 
                             scalar curvature Kähler metric using test configurations. Combining our techniques with the non-Archimedean approach to K-stability pioneered by Boucksom-Jonsson, we show that the 
                             properness of the classical  energy can be tested by checking its slope along a distinguished subclass of Li-type models, called log discrepancy models, thus yielding another G-uniform 
                             Yau--Tian--Donaldson correspondence. (Joint with Kewei Zhang)</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: Uniqueness of mean curvature flow evolution</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: The smooth mean curvature flow often develops singularities, making weak solutions essential for extending the flow beyond singular times, as well as having applications for 
                             geometry and topology. Among various weak formulations, the level set flow method is notable for ensuring long-time existence and uniqueness. However, this comes at the cost of 
                             potential fattening, which reflects genuine non-uniqueness of the flow after singular times. Even for flows starting from smooth, embedded, closed initial data, such non-uniqueness 
                             can occur. Thus, we can't expect genuine uniqueness in general. Addressing this non-uniqueness issue is a difficult problem. With Alec Payne, we establish an intersection principle 
                             comparing two intersecting flows. We prove that level set flows satisfy this principle in the absence of non-uniqueness.</p></li>
