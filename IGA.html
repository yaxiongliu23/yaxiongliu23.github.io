                             can be used to construct holomorphic functions and prove various 
                             quantitative results in several complex variables. We will present some

            <li><p>Abstract: In this talk, we construct new examples of constant scalar curvature K&aumlhler(cscK) metrics of Poincar&eacute type from existing cscK ones. 
              The construction is obtained via gluing a cscK metric on a compact K&aumlhler manifold to a complete scalar-flat K&aumlhler metric of Poincar&eacute type on 
              $\mathbb{C}^n$ removing the origin. Assuming the compact K&aumlhler manifold has no non-trivial holomorphic vector field, we prove the existence of 
              cscK metrics of Poincar&eacute type on this compact manifold removing finitely many points.</p></li>

            <li><p>Abstract: We study the Brunn-Minkowski and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities on a Riemannian manifold endowed with an exact magnetic field, 
              replacing geodesics by minimizers of an action functional given by the length minus the integral of the magnetic potential. 
              We also review earlier work, joint with Klartag, in the special case of the hyperbolic plane.</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: Complete Calabi--Yau metrics and singular K&aumlhler--Einstein metrics asymptotic to cones</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: We relate the geometry of complete Calabi--Yau metrics and singular K&aumlhler--Einstein metrics to their tangent cones under certain assumption 
              on the curvature.  Building on Donaldson--Sun’s 2-step degeneration theory, we proved an asymmetric phenomenon between the global and local setting.

            <li><p>Abstract: Given a reflexive polytope with a height function, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for solvability of the associated Monge-Ampère equation. 
              We also improve on existing results regarding the SYZ conjecture for the Fermat family by showing regularity of the limiting potential.  Joint work with J. Hultgren.</p></li>

            <li><p>Abstract: In joint work with A. Seppi and J. Toulouse we solve the Plateau problem for complete, maximal spacelike submanifolds of pseudohyperbolic 
              space $\Bbb{H}^{p,q}$, with interesting applications to the study of Anosov representations in $\text{O}(p,q+1)$. In this talk, I will discuss some of

            <li><p>Title: The Diederich-Fornaess Exponent and the Worm Domain</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract:  By a classical result of Diedrich and Fornaess for a bounded pseudoconvex domain in C^n with smooth boundary one can find a smooth 
              defining function \rho and b>0 such that -(-\rho)^b is plurisubharmonic. Such a b is called a Diederich-Fornaess exponent. We will give a quantitative 
              version of this result and also present the situation for the worm domains, generalizing a result of B. Liu.

        <ul>
            <li><p>Speaker: Ziquan Zhuang (JHU)</p></li>
            <li><p>Title: Boundedness of singularities and discreteness of local volumes</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: The local volume of a Kawamata log terminal (klt) singularity is an invariant that plays a central role in the local theory of K-stability. 
              By the stable degeneration theorem, every klt singularity has a volume preserving degeneration to a K-semistable Fano cone singularity. 
              I will talk about a joint work with Chenyang Xu on the boundedness of Fano cone singularities when the volume is bounded away from zero. 
              This implies that local volumes only accumulate around zero in any given dimension.</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: The signature operator on Witt spaces</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: A Witt space is a particular kind of pseudomanifold. A singular complex projective variety is an example
                        of Witt space; the space obtained as the quotient of a non-free actions of a compact Lie group 
                        on a smooth closed compact manifold is also a Witt space under certain additional assumptions on the action.
                        Witt spaces enjoy extremely interesting properties, both from the point of view of topology and analysis.
                        In this talk I will explain mainly the analytic side,  concentrating on a very significant example: the signature operator.
                        talk is based on joint work (scattered in several papers) with Pierre Albin, Markus Banagl, Eric Leichtnam, Rafe Mazzeo
                        and Boris Vertman.</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: An Approach to Dimension Reduction for Generalized Anti-Self-Dual Instantons</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: In this talk, I will describe joint work with Langte Ma studying dimension reduction phenomena for absolute minimizers of 
                            the Yang-Mills functional. This work is motivated by special holonomy geometry and I will emphasize applications to gauge 
                            theory on special holonomy manifolds. I will explain the general approach to such phenomena that we develop, characterizing 
                            the moduli space of generalized anti-self-dual instantons on certain bundles over product Riemannian manifolds equipped with 
                            a parallel codimension-4 differential form. One outcome of this is an explicit description of instanton moduli spaces over 
                            certain product special holonomy manifolds.</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: Probing moduli spaces with sub-line bundles </p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: The moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and flat connections on a Riemann surface play important roles in several parts of mathematics
                             and mathematical physics. I will explain how considering Higgs bundles/flat connections together with sub-line bundles of the 
                             underlying bundles is useful in yielding explicit descriptions of these moduli spaces. Curiously, this method is inspired by the 
                             Separation of Variables method for integrable systems on one hand and related to the extended Bogomolny equations on the other hand. 
                             As a result, for the GL_n and SL_n cases, we can construct certain Lagrangians in the moduli of Higgs bundles that are, in retrospect, 
                             natural from this point of view. Furthermore, for the rank-2 case, we can also explicitly describe components in the wobbly locus 
                              in the moduli of stable bundles. </p></li>

            <li><p>Title: Fibrations on the 6-sphere and Clemens threefolds </p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: Let Z be a compact, connected 3-dimensional complex manifold with vanishing first and second Betti numbers and non-vanishing Euler 
                            characteristic. We prove that there is no holomorphic mapping from Z onto any 2-dimensional complex space. In other words, Z can only 
                            possibly fiber over a curve. This result applies in particular to a class of threefolds, known as Clemens threefolds, which are 
                            diffeomorphic to a connected sum of k copies of S<sup>3</sup> &times S<sup>3</sup> for k > 1. This result also gives a new restriction on any hypothetical 
                            complex structure on the 6-sphere S<sup>6</sup>. This is joint work with Nobuhiro Honda. </p></li>

            <li><p>Title: Products on Fixed point Floer cohomology and closed string mirror symmetry for nodal curves </p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: The fixed point Floer cohomology is a cochain complex generated by the fixed points of a symplectomorphism. It has been computed for all symplectomorphisms 
                             on (2 real-dimensional) surfaces, but it enjoys additional algebraic structure coming from a pair of pants "product". We explain the computation of this 
                             "product" in the case of iterations of a Dehn twists on a surface. We find surprisingly, the resulting structure forms a polynomial ring. Via the lens of 
                             mirror symmetry, we relate this ring to sections of tensor powers of a degree 1 line bundle on a nodal elliptic curve. Finally, using the product structure, 
                             we explain how to define a version of genus 0 Gromov Witten invariants for nodal Riemann surfaces and compute it. 
                             All of this joint work with Maxim Jeffs and Ziwen Zhao. </p></li>

            <li><p>Title: On the hole event for random complex zeros </p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: In this talk, based on joint work with Alon Nishry (Tel Aviv University) I will describe some curious phenomena related to rare events for random analytic functions, 
                            more precisely the Gaussian Entire Function (GEF). The GEF is a random Taylor series with i.i.d. centered Gaussian coefficients, whose variances are chosen so that the 
                            zero set of the GEF has translation invariant law. This zero set satisfies a number of interesting properties. For instance, the fluctuations of the number of zeros in 
                            a large ball behaves like that of a perturbed lattice (the zeros form a hyperuniform point process).

                            <p>We consider the following questions: Fix a region G in the plane of unit area, and let R be a large parameter. Rescaling the GEF to have zero intensity R, we would expect 
                            around R^2 zeros in G. Asymptotically as R tends to infinity, what is the probability of the rare event that there are no zeros in G (the “hole probability”)? And conditioned 
                            on this “hole event”, what is the limiting distribution of the remaining zeros, and how does it depend on the shape of G? </p>

                            <p>Ghosh and Nishry (CPAM ’19) discovered that there emerges a forbidden region outside the hole G, where the zero density vanishes in the limit. In joint work with Alon Nishry, 
                            we studied the relationship between the geometry of the hole and that of the forbidden region. I plan to describe our results, including some striking rigidity properties of 
                            the forbidden region, and a curious connection to quadrature domains from potential theory.</p>  </p></li>
