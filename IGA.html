<h2></h2>
<p>The seminar aims to be a relaxed forum for researchers and graduate students interested in geometric analysis, and students of all levels are encouraged to attend and ask questions. 
  Talks will focus on the "big picture" and key ideas and encourage interaction. Talks will be in the format: 
   30-minute talks followed by a ~ 15-30 minute discussion.</p>

            <li><p>Speaker: Zbigniew Blocki (Jagiellonian University)</p></li>
            <li><p>Title:  \bar\partial and ODEs</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: H&oumlrmander's L^2-estimate for \bar\partial and its generalizations 
                             can be used to construct holomorphic functions and prove various 
                             quantitative results in several complex variables. We will present some 
                             known and new \bar\partial-estimates and their relations with ODEs.

            <li><p>Title: A gluing construction of constant scalar curvature K&aumlhler metrics of Poincar&eacute type</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: In this talk, we construct new examples of constant scalar curvature K&aumlhler(cscK) metrics of Poincar&eacute type from existing cscK ones. 
              The construction is obtained via gluing a cscK metric on a compact K&aumlhler manifold to a complete scalar-flat K&aumlhler metric of Poincar&eacute type on 
              $\mathbb{C}^n$ removing the origin. Assuming the compact K&aumlhler manifold has no non-trivial holomorphic vector field, we prove the existence of 
              cscK metrics of Poincar&eacute type on this compact manifold removing finitely many points.</p></li>

            <li><p>Speaker: Rotem Assouline (Weizmann)</p></li>
            <li><p>Title: Magnetic Brunn-Minkowski and Optimal Transport</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: We study the Brunn-Minkowski and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities on a Riemannian manifold endowed with an exact magnetic field, 
              replacing geodesics by minimizers of an action functional given by the length minus the integral of the magnetic potential. 
              We also review earlier work, joint with Klartag, in the special case of the hyperbolic plane.</p></li>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Speaker: Junsheng Zhang (SLMath)</p></li>
            <li><p>Title: Complete Calabi--Yau metrics and singular K&aumlhler--Einstein metrics asymptotic to cones</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: We relate the geometry of complete Calabi--Yau metrics and singular K&aumlhler--Einstein metrics to their tangent cones under certain assumption 
              on the curvature.  Building on Donaldson--Sun’s 2-step degeneration theory, we proved an asymmetric phenomenon between the global and local setting. 
              Part of the talk is based on joint work with Song Sun.</p></li>

            <li><p>Abstract: This talk will give an overview of joint work with R. Berman that
                  gives sharp bounds on the height of K-semistable (arithmetic) Fano varieties</p></li>

            <li><p>Title: SYZ Conjecture and real Monge-Ampere equations</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: Given a reflexive polytope with a height function, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for solvability of the associated Monge-Ampère equation. 
              We also improve on existing results regarding the SYZ conjecture for the Fermat family by showing regularity of the limiting potential.  Joint work with J. Hultgren.</p></li>

  <li><p>November 19 (10-11am, not usual time)</p></li>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Speaker: Graham Andrew Smith (PUC-Rio)</p></li>
            <li><p>Title: Maximal submanifolds of pseudohyperbolic space</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: In joint work with A. Seppi and J. Toulouse we solve the Plateau problem for complete, maximal spacelike submanifolds of pseudohyperbolic 
              space $\Bbb{H}^{p,q}$, with interesting applications to the study of Anosov representations in $\text{O}(p,q+1)$. In this talk, I will discuss some of 
              the analytic aspects of our construction..</p></li>

            <li><p>Speaker: Zbigniew Blocki (Jagiellonian University)</p></li>
            <li><p>Title: The Diederich-Fornaess Exponent and the Worm Domain</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract:  By a classical result of Diedrich and Fornaess for a bounded pseudoconvex domain in C^n with smooth boundary one can find a smooth 
              defining function \rho and b>0 such that -(-\rho)^b is plurisubharmonic. Such a b is called a Diederich-Fornaess exponent. We will give a quantitative 
              version of this result and also present the situation for the worm domains, generalizing a result of B. Liu.
</p></li>
        </ul>
  <li><p>November 21, 3.15pm, joint with Complex Geometry & Algebraic Geometry Seminar in room 1310. </p></li>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Speaker: Ziquan Zhuang (JHU)</p></li>
            <li><p>Title: Boundedness of singularities and discreteness of local volumes</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: The local volume of a Kawamata log terminal (klt) singularity is an invariant that plays a central role in the local theory of K-stability. 
              By the stable degeneration theorem, every klt singularity has a volume preserving degeneration to a K-semistable Fano cone singularity. 
              I will talk about a joint work with Chenyang Xu on the boundedness of Fano cone singularities when the volume is bounded away from zero. 
              This implies that local volumes only accumulate around zero in any given dimension.</p></li>
        </ul>
  <li><p>November 26, Thanksgiving break, no talk.</p></li>
  <li><p>December 10 (MTH 1310)</p></li>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Speaker: Paolo Piazza</p></li>
            <li><p>Title: The signature operator on Witt spaces</p></li>
            <li><p>Abstract: A Witt space is a particular kind of pseudomanifold. A singular complex projective variety is an example
                        of Witt space; the space obtained as the quotient of a non-free actions of a compact Lie group 
                        on a smooth closed compact manifold is also a Witt space under certain additional assumptions on the action.
                        Witt spaces enjoy extremely interesting properties, both from the point of view of topology and analysis.
                        In this talk I will explain mainly the analytic side,  concentrating on a very significant example: the signature operator.
                        talk is based on joint work (scattered in several papers) with Pierre Albin, Markus Banagl, Eric Leichtnam, Rafe Mazzeo
                        and Boris Vertman.</p></li>
